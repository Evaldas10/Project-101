# Project-101

This is a demonstration, visually focused website created to showcase
user interface (UI) layout and design.

The project was developed independently as a way to practice and
strengthen my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Core functionality such as reservation handling and backend logic
is not fully implemented. The main focus of this project is on
visual presentation, layout, and overall structure.
